# Linear-Equations-Solver
This Python project aims to build a linear equation solver program. Users are requested to input 4 variables that define 2 linear equations in slope-intercept form (y = ax + b). 

The solver works for any numerical inputs, including fractions, exponentials, additions and subtraction, just to name a few.
Have fun!

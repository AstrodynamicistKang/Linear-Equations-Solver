# Linear-Equations-Solver
This Python project aims to build a linear equation solver program. Users are requested to input 4 variables that define 2 linear equations in slope-intercept form (y = ax + b) and configures the solver's step-size and range before having the solver determines if the delta-y value converges within the given range defined by the user.
